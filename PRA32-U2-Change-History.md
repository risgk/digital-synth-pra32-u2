## Digital Synth PRA32-U2 Change History

- v0.5.0 (2025-**-**):
    - Extend Oscillator, Filter, and Amp inputs and outputs to 24-bit (int32_t)
    - Extend Filter Key Track range and resolution (0.0 to 1.0, step 0.5 -> -1.000 to +1.000, step 0.125)
    - Fix a problem where Filter Key Track correction was off to the plus side
    - Fix a problem with EG/Amp Sustain level not changing in note on states
    - Change Preset programs
    - Tested with Arduino-Pico version 4.6.0
- v0.4.0 (2025-06-30):
    - Increase the maximum overtone of Oscillator output in the low frequency range
    - Merge Osc 1 Multi Saw to Saw Wave
    - Enable Osc 1 Morph for Multi Saw
    - Enable Osc 1 Shape and Morph for Sync Square
    - Improve Filter Cutoff frequency accuracy (4x)
    - Change the signal flow: Change the points at which the levels change
    - Extend Delay Time range (1 to 333.3 -> 1 to 340 ms)
    - Revert the specification change of Chorus Mix
